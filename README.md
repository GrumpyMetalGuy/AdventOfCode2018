# Advent Of Code 2018

This year, I'm doing this in Rust. With Rust 2018 edition newly released, this seems like a good time to use it, rather than Python.

No effort has been made to implement proper error handling here. All very crude, with no proper Result usage. If it breaks, it panics. Don't use this
as a template for proper work :)
